## About the Repository
### img
This is a collection of images utilized on the web application to directly source. All image references will be hosted directly on the cloud that will be dedicated to the web application, and uploaded from the img folder

### node_modules
The web application utilizes MongoDB Atlas, and will soon use Google Cloud to deploy it's data. For the application to connect to MongoDB, the services will be sent through Node.js, and installation of Node.js and MongoDB modules need to exist in the environment. This folder holds the relevant plugins and installations to link the two.
